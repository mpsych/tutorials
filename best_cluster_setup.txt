## The best cluster setup for the UMass Boston Gibbs Cluster.

**Requirements**
- You need an account. Get it here: https://www.umb.edu/rc/hpc/gibbs

**Summary**
IMHO this is the best way of working on the Gibbs cluster. 
It sets up a) a virtual environment with anaconda for python and all kinds of stuff, 
b) a tunnel directly to a compute node so you can access jupyter there, and 
c) a SSHFS link to a cluster folder so you edit files on your local machine.

##
##
## Step 1: Setup Conda Environment and Jupyter
##
##
##

#
# connect to vpn using the client from http://vpn.umb.edu
#


#
# connect to login node
#
ssh USERNAME@gibbs.umb.edu


#
# connect to compute machine (e.g. GTX670, K20, TITAN, K80...) see https://www.umb.edu/rc/hpc/gibbs for options
# the partitions are named after the GPUs
#
# this also reserves 16 GB RAM and 1 GPU
#
srun --pty -t 7-12:00 --export=ALL --ntasks=1 -p K80 --gres=gpu --mem=16000 /bin/bash

#
# load anaconda
#
module load python/anaconda3.7

#
# create new environment PYTORCH
#
conda create --name PYTORCH python=3.6

#
# here i had to logout and login to make activating the environment work
#

#
# activate environment
#
conda activate PYTORCH

#
# install jupter notebook
#
conda install jupyter

# generate a jupyter notebook config file
jupyter notebook --generate-config

#
# IMPORTANT: CONFIGURE JUPYTER
#
vi ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

# store this in the file
c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.password = u'' # HERE YOU NEED TO GENERATE ONE WITH from notebook.auth import passwd; passwd()
c.NotebookApp.port = 41235
# best also to activate SSL encryption! (look here: https://testnb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Configuring%20the%20Notebook%20and%20Server.html)

#
# END OF IMPORTANT
# 

#
# install other standard packages for image processing and deep learning
#
conda install scikit-image scikit-learn pytorch

#
# install and start tmux
#
conda install -c conda-forge tmux
tmux

#
#
#
conda activate PYTORCH

#
# check commpute host name
#
uname -a
Linux gibs11.gibbs.local

#
# go to github checkout (cloning at this point from github only works with HTTPS)
#
cd YOURCODE

#
# start jupyter notebook and let it run in tmux
#
jupyter notebook







##
##
##
## Step 2: Connect to Tunnel and allow access through your local IP (which means from everywhere if you have a public one)
##
##
##
##

#
#
# NOW AT YOUR LOCAL MACHINE
# 
#

#
# start tmux
#
tmux

#
# connect 
#
ssh USERNAME@gibbs.umb.edu -L 8002:0.0.0.0:8001 ssh USERNAME@gibbs.umb.edu -L 8001:localhost:41235

#
# and leave it open
#

#
# now you can connect to http://YOUR_IP:8002/
# if you want to connect locally, you can use 127.0.0.1 or localhost for YOUR_IP
# please make sure jupyter notebook has SSL activated and a password set
#

# Now, you have a jupyter instance running where code gets executed on gibbs! How cool is that!!



##
##
##
## Step 3: Link a cluster folder locally using SSHFS
##
## This allows you to edit cluster files from your local machine!
##
##

# make mount point
mkdir compute_cluster

ssh -f USERNAME@odyssey.rc.fas.harvard.edu -L 2233:0.0.0.0:22 -N
sshfs -p 2233 USERNAME@127.0.0.1:/home/USERNAME/Projects/compute compute_cluster
# above assumes your github check out is compute in your Projects folder
# USERNAME is of course your gibbs username

#
# and all the cluster files can be edited now in your local editor
#

# LATER, if you want to use an already existing conda environment on the cluster:
#
module load python/anaconda3.7
conda activate PYTORCH

# always tmux
tmux
